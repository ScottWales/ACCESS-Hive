In case you do not have a lot of time, please consider sharing your ideas via Issues on the ACCESS-Hive GitHub repository so someone might be able to add them to the ACCESS-Hive site for you. Abstract The aim of this How to is to enable you to: add or modify a link to a new documentation in an existing page add a new page or tab with new documentation This documentation is based on the Material for Mkdocs theme. Please see the documentation for the theme or for Mkdocs for a full explanation of all the capabilities. The documentation is written in Markdown format. Please see this cheat sheet for a quick reference to the base syntax. Please note that Material for Mkdocs extends that syntax. Setup If you want to contribute to the ACCESS-Hive, it is recommended to become a member of the ACCESS-Hive organisation. Unfortunately, GitHub does not provide a system to request membership, please send a request on the General channel of ACCESS-NRI's Slack workspace : specify your GitHub username tag the tech account with @tech account . Get the documentation source You need to clone the ACCESS-Hive repository to your local machine: git clone git@github.com:ACCESS-Hive/ACCESS-Hive.git Install Material for Mkdocs (not required) If you would like to preview the documentation locally to check your modifications before submitting them to the ACCESS-Hive site and you are comfortable with installing Python packages, you will need to install Material for Mkdocs. However, this is not required as there is a preview available as part of the submission process . You can install Material for Mkdocs on your local machine with pip or conda : using pip pip install mkdocs-material using conda conda create -n doc -c conda-forge mkdocs-material Additional plugins The following plugins will also need to be installed if you want to preview the documentation locally, using the same method as for mkdocs-material: mkdocs-git-revision-date-localized-plugin mkdocs-macros-plugin Modify the documentation There are two ways to modify the documentation: direct edit on GitHub . This method is adequate for small modifications to a single file. local edit on your local computer . This method is recommended for large modifications. Open an issue For all additions or modifications to the ACCESS-Hive site, it is recommended to start by opening an Issue in the ACCESS-Hive GitHub repository. After creation, please assign the Issue to yourself in the right-hand side panel if you intend on working on the issue. Edit directly on GitHub For a very simple change, the easiest is to go to the page you want to modify on the ACCESS-Hive documentation site. At the right of the title, you will see a pen icon . Pen icon circled in red When you click on this icon, your browser will open the file in GitHub allowing you to edit the file. Enter your modification in the main pane. Then add a commit message in the Commit changes box. Where to write your commit message Important The main branch of the repository is protected and nobody can write to it directly. You will need to choose either to create a new branch and open a pull request if you are a member of ACCESS-Hive organisation, or to create a fork on your personal account and open a pull request if you are not a member of ACCESS-Hive organisation. When creating the pull request, make sure to add the text: Closes #X to the description, where X is the issue number related to this change. This will link the pull request and the issue together and the issue will be automatically closed once the pull request is accepted. The pull request will also automatically build a preview of the documentation with your proposed changes . Then ask for a review by tagging the @ACCESS-Hive/reviewers team in a comment. You will be notified by email of any subsequent comment, request or action from the reviewer on this pull request. Please make sure you take any action required by the reviewer or your modification will not be accepted into the ACCESS-Hive site. Headers and table of content The level 1 headers are reserved for the title of the page and are ignored from the pages' table of contents. Only use level 2 headers and higher to organise pages. Edit locally on your computer If you prefer to work locally on your computer (e.g. to preview the result of your modification locally before submitting it to the documentation), you will need to follow the usual series of steps when contributing to Open Source developments: open an Issue clone the repository locally start a branch to work on, linked to the Issue commit your modifications to that branch and push to GitHub open a pull request between the main branch and your branch ask for reviews and reply to requests for changes If you don't know how to do these steps, please refer to our Git and GitHub training . What page to edit If you have problems finding the page you need to edit, the easiest way is to head to the ACCESS-Hive site. If you click on the pen icon at the top right of each page title, you will open a GitHub page showing you the path to the file you want to edit. Headers and table of content The level 1 headers are reserved for the title of the page and are ignored from the pages' table of contents. Only use level 2 headers and higher to organise pages. Previewing your changes locally Requires software installation You can only preview your local changes if you have installed mkdocs-material on your computer. If you have installed mkdocs-material via conda, make sure you activate the correct environment first MkDocs includes a live preview server, so you can preview your changes as you write your documentation. The server will automatically rebuild the site upon saving. To start the server, open a terminal and navigate to your ACCESS-Hive local repository. Now type: mkdocs serve Your documentation will be built on http://127.0.0.1:8000. Open this URL in your browser to see a preview of the documentation. The URL is given in the terminal when running the mkdocs serve command. Make sure you keep the command running so as to see live updates on saving your modifications. Preview of the documentation When a pull request is created or updated, GitHub will automatically build a preview of the documentation that includes the proposed changes. In the pull request, you will see the link to the preview appear in this fashion: Build delay It can take a while for the preview to build, even after the CI check is indicated as finished. Please wait for the comment with the link to appear and allow for some time after that for the preview to be properly deployed. If you open the preview and it looks completely broken or if it hasn't updated from additional modifications in the pull request, it probably means the site hasn't finished building yet. If you wait a little bit and refresh the page, it should fix it. Change the navigation Structure of the repository The important elements of the repository to know about before modifying the navigation are: docs/ folder: this folder contains all the documentation pages. There is an index.md file for the Welcome page, one folder per tab on the site and an assets/ folder to store images used in the documentation. mkdocs.yml : it is a YAML formatted file, hence the .yml extension. The site navigation is defined in this file as well as options for the styling of the site. YAML YAML is a popular choice for configuration files, as it is a simple way of encoding data structures in a text file. See this short tutorial . A simple example The easiest way to explain how the navigation is defined is to look at an example. Let's say mkdocs.yml contains: nav : - Welcome : index.md - ACCESS-NRI : ACCESS-NRI/ACCESS-NRI.md - Community : - Generate Bathymetry : community/bathymetry.md - How to contribute : - How to contribute : help/how_to_contribute.md - Setup : help/contribution_setup.md - Modify the documentation : help/modify_documentation.md - Change the navigation : help/change_navigation.md The top level category names define the tabs in the header bar. So here we have the tabs: \"Welcome\", \"ACCESS-NRI\", \"Community\" and \"How to contribute\". It also defines the name of the top section under each tab. The second level of categories indicate the name of each page under that section. So the \"ACCESS-NRI\" tab has the text directly under the section \"ACCESS-NRI\". The \"Community\" tab has a section called \"Community\" that contains one page: \"Generate Bathymetry\". Finally, the \"How to contribute\" tab has 1 section \"How to contribute\" with 4 pages. The filenames indicate the path to the file relative to the docs/ folder containing the text for each page. It is recommended to use the title of each file (i.e. the Header 1) as the name of the page and the filename. Add sections to a tab It is possible to define several sections per tab by using more levels of indentation. For example, to add a \"My example\" section to the \"How to contribute\" tab: nav : - Welcome : index.md - ACCESS-NRI : ACCESS-NRI/ACCESS-NRI.md - Community : - Generate Bathymetry : community/bathymetry.md - How to contribute : - How to contribute : help/how_to_contribute.md - Setup : help/contribution_setup.md - Modify the documentation : help/modify_documentation.md - Change the navigation : help/change_navigation.md - My example : - Beautiful example : help/beautiful_example.md will create this navigation:","title":"How to Contribute"},{"location":"about/contribute/#how-to-contribute-guide","text":"Although we encourage everyone to get involved and contribute to the ACCESS-Hive in order to adequately represent the needs of the entire ACCESS community, we recognise not everyone will have the time to do so.

COSIMA Workhop 3 - 4 November 2022, Hobart, TAS Registration closes COB 16 September 2022 Ground truthing future climate change AMOS 2022, 27 November 2022, Adelaide, SA Convenors: Dr Sarah Kachovich, Dr Linda Armbrecht, Dr Luke Nothdurft Scientific ocean drilling provides the robust baseline data on global climate evolution over extended geologic time periods that are critical for improving climate model performance. By targeting how the climate system operates across a wide array of past climate states, scientific ocean drilling has, and continues to, obtain the data necessary to calibrate and improve numerical models used to project future climate impacts and inform mitigation strategies. Join us in this session where we aim to connect climate and ocean modellers to our rich (50+ years of drilling) database and unanswered questions in scientific ocean drilling. By addressing key questions about Earth\u2019s past, present, and future through interdisciplinary research, we are aiming to spark new collaborations and proposals that will lead to a more profound understanding of Earth as one integrated, interconnected system. The Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite: A primer AMOS 2022, 27 November 2022, Adelaide, SA Convenors: Dr Benoit Legresy, Dr Shane Keating, Prof. Nicole Jones The Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite, which will launch in November 2022, is a ground-breaking wide-swath altimetry mission that will observe fine details of the ocean dynamics at a resolution 10 times finer than current satellites. SWOT is jointly developed by NASA and CNES with contributions from researchers around the world, including Australia. The Australian government, the Integrated Marine Observing System, and the Australian marine science community are investing in SWOT through calibration/validation and synergistic in situ measurements of fine-scale ocean dynamics in the Australian region. This workshop will present a primer on the principles of the satellite and instrument, how it works, and what are its possibilities and limitations compared to existing altimetry products. This will be complemented with a brief summary of ocean research related to and enabled by SWOT, including internal waves and tides, sub-mesoscale dynamics, the geoid, and mean dynamic topography. The goal of the workshop is to provide oceanographers, hydrologists and other users of altimetry data with the information they need to prepare for the arrival of SWOT data in late 2023. Australian Community Climate and Earth System Simulator (ACCESS) modelling AMOS 2022, 27 November 2022, Adelaide, SA Convenors: Dr Tilo Ziehn, Arnold Sullivan This half-day workshop introduces running the ACCESS model for new or less experienced users. We focus on the ACCESSESM1.5. The workshop will use a few simple cases to demonstrate how to set up and run the model on NCI's Gadi and focus on what post-processing package is available. Since ACCESS-ESM1.5 is cheaper and faster than ACCESS-CM2, we target to use the Payu through the workshop. We might cover some other components, but it might depend on the time and the users. Participants will need to bring their laptops and have an NCI account; participants may need to prepare before the workshop; the instructions will be loaded online before the event. The workshop will collaborate with CSIRO Aspendale, ACCESS-NRI and CLEX. Regional climate downscaling for Australia within the CORDEX framework AMOS 2022, 27 November 2022, Adelaide, SA Convenors: Jason Evans, Marcus Thatcher This workshop is relevant for those performing regional climate simulations or downscaling with empirical/statistical downscaling approaches including machine learning, as well as those using regional climate projection data in their work. The focus will be on CORDEX related data and modelling. The workshop will have some presentations with extended discussion. Some topics to be covered include: - Accessing the existing CORDEX-CMIP5 data. How to access and use the data - Explain the CORDEX-CMIP6 protocol - What does it say?

The Unified Model (UM) The Unified Model (UM) is a numerical model of the atmosphere used for both weather and climate applications, developed by the Met Office in the United Kingdom (UK). It includes solutions of the equations of atmospheric fluid dynamics with advanced parameterizations of subgrid-scale physical processes like convection, cloud formation and atmospheric radiation. The Unified Model gets its name because a single model is used across a wide range of both timescales (nowcasting to centennial) and spatial scales (sub km convective scale to global climate modelling). The UM is used by several international operational meteorology and research organizations and these contribute towards its development through the UM partnership. How is the UM used? The UM Model component represents the atmosphere in many of the ACCESS Models used at regional and global scales. The ACCESS-CM2 climate model and ACCESS-ESM1-5 earth system model use versions of the UM as their atmospheric components. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology operational 12 km spatial resolution global forecasting system uses the Unified Model, as part of ACCESS for: Forecasting of extreme events and emergencies such as heatwaves, bushfires, cyclones, floods, coral bleaching, sea-level rise, coastal inundation and more.

CABLE The Community Atmosphere Biosphere Land Exchange model (CABLE) is a land-surface model that simulates energy, water and carbon flows between the land surface and the atmosphere. This component has been developed by Australian researchers across the national climate science community. How is CABLE used? CABLE can be run as a standalone model, for a single location, a region or globally. The model is coupled to the Met Office Unified Model (UM) and provides the land surface component of the Earth System Models ACCESS-ESM1-5 and ACCESS-CM2. CABLE is an open source model. Registration is required to access the CABLE code repository.

ESMValTool is open to both users and developers, encouraging open exchange of diagnostic source code and evaluation results from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project CMIP ensemble. For a comprehensive introduction to ESMValTool please visit our documentation page. METPLUS Tutorial METplus is a verification framework that spans a wide range of temporal (warn-on-forecast to climate) and spatial (storm to global) scales. It is intended to be extensible through additional capability developed by the community. The core components of the framework include MET, the associated database and display systems called METviewer and METexpress, and a suite of Python wrappers to provide low-level automation and examples, also called use-cases. METplus will be a component of NOAA's Unified Forecast System (UFS) cross-cutting infrastructure as well as NCAR's System for Integrated Modeling of the Atmosphere (SIMA). METplus is being actively developed by NCAR/Research Applications Laboratory (RAL), NOAA/Earth Systems Research Laboratories (ESRL), NOAA/Environmental Modeling Center (EMC), and is open to community contributions.
